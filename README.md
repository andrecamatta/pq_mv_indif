# Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization with Indifference Curves

This project implements mean-variance portfolio optimization with indifference curves in Julia. It visualizes:

- Utility contour plots for different risk aversion coefficients
- Indifference curves for various risk aversion values
- The efficient frontier with optimal portfolio allocation

## Files

- `figures.jl`: Julia script that generates all visualizations
- Output files (not included in repository):
  - `figures.png`: Contour plots showing utility for different risk aversion coefficients
  - `indifference_curves.png`: Indifference curves for different risk aversion values
  - `efficient_frontier.png`: The efficient frontier with indifference curves

## Usage

Run the Julia script to generate the visualizations:

```julia
julia figures.jl
```
